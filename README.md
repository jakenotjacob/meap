A following of the Rails 4 in Action book by Ryan Bigg &amp; Yehuda Katz.

As my second tutorial and experience with Ruby on Rails, I intend to do this
one a bit differently, in making notes on each Chapter with core values that I 
have learned and feel are important concepts (more than anything, for future 
reference for myself), as well as the reasoning behind certain portions of code.

I intend for this to lead to a greater and in-depth understanding of RoR that 
will soon pave the way to put the thoughts and ideas I have into action.

Let's begin!
